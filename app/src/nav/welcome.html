<p>Welcome to the Firebase Demo application.</p>
<p>Use the navigation bar on the left (or collapsed into the header on small screens) to open to one of the demonstrations.</p>
<p>There are two available demonstrations. Both utilize Firebase to enable real-time synchronization of the display to all connected users. The Grid demo shows a grid of stateful buttons. The Draw demo shows a canvas with a shared drawing.</p>
<p>To use the Grid demo, press the Grid navigation option on the left. Press a button to change its state. The Clear button at the bottom will reset all buttons. The Blitz button will randomly change states of the buttons for two seconds.</p>
<p>To use the Draw demo, press the Draw navigation option on the left. To draw a line, click once where you would like the line to begin, and once again where you would like the line to end. You can create a curve by clicking and dragging the beginning of the line, the end of the line, or both. To draw lines in different colors, use the color picker button at the bottom of the screen. To erase a line, click the Erase button, and then click on a line.</p>
<p>The current connection to Firebase is displayed in the upper right corner of the title bar. A white rectangle means you are connected, and a red circle with an X means you are not.</p>

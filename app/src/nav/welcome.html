<p>Welcome to the Firebase Demo application.</p>
<p>Use the navigation bar on the left (or collapsed into the header on small screens) to open to one of the demonstrations.</p>
<p>There are two available demonstrations. Both utilize Firebase to enable real-time synchronization of the display to all connected users. The Grid demo shows a grid of stateful buttons. The Draw demo shows a canvas with a shared drawing.</p>
<p>The current connection to Firebase is displayed in the upper right corner of the title bar.</p>
